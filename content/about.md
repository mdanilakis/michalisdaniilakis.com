Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michalis Daniilakis.

<p></p>

{{< image classes="fig-50 clear" src="/images/content/olympus-me.png" title="Mt. Olympus - Greece" >}}

I'm a software engineer, with long experience in Cloud and Web development. I architect solutions, write a lot of Java code, but also scripts in Python and bash.

I am a huge fan of infrastructure as code, unix and git.

Check my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/mdanilakis) for more information.
